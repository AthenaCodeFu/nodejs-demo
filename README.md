## Part 1

## Part 2
Part 2 was given on 03-09-2015, and covered webservice architecture in general, discussed athenahealth's various webservice implementations and infrastructure components, and demoed a toy/incomplete PDF conversion webservice that could be used to answer an existing scalability need in athenaNet's production infrastructure.

Demo materials (along with a very large writeup on the PDF conversion service and its raison d'Ãªtre) are in the `Part 2` folder.

The other materials referred to in the presentation (which is in `Part 2/Presentation.pptx`) are:

- [Service-oriented architecture as part of a development *process* redesign (not just as a technology redesign) at SoundCloud](http://philcalcado.com/2015/09/08/how_we_ended_up_with_microservices.html).
- My dispatch and transport rant (available [internally](https://platform.blog.athenahealth.com/2014/11/24/transport-and-dispatch/) and, in a redacted/more general form, [externally](http://logicfault.blogspot.com/2014/11/dispatch-and-transport-systems.html)).
